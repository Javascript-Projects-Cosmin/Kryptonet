![Krypt](https://i.ibb.co/DVF4tNW/image.png)

## Introduction
This project was made by following a Web 3.0 course/tutorial by JavaScript Mastery. It taught the basics of blockchain technology, wallets, transfers, and the ethers module to create the smart contract. I will leave the original ReadMe description down below as well.

This is a code repository for the corresponding video tutorial.

Using Web 3.0 methodologies, Solidity and Metamask you'll learn how to build a your first real Web 3.0 Application - from start to finish.
